    I'm Nobody! Who are you?<br>
    Are you - Nobody - Too?<br>
    Then there's a pair of us!<br>
    Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!
    </p><p>
    How dreary - to be - Somebody!<Br>
    How public - like a Frog -<br>
    To tell one's name - the livelong June -<br>
    To an admiring Bog!</p>
